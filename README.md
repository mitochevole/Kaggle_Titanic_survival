A binary classification problem in which, starting with a dataset of ten different numerical and categorical variables describing individual Titanic passengers, we are asked to predict wether they lived or died during the shipwreck.

A First notebook presents my first attempt to approach this problem, with the use of only basic strategies and little feature engineering the achieved score is 78%.
